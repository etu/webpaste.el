;;; Commentary:

;; This mode allows to paste whole buffers or parts of buffers to
;; pastebin-like services.  It supports more than one service and will
;; failover if one service fails.  More services can easily be added
;; over time and preferred services can easily be configured.

Usage:
  (webpaste--provider
    [:keyword [option]]...)

Required params:
:uri               URI that we should do the request to to paste data.

:post-field        Name of the field to insert the code into.

:success-lambda    Callback sent to `request', look up how to write these in the
                   documentation for `request'.  Two good examples are
                   `webpaste--providers-success-location-header' and
                   `webpaste--providers-success-returned-string' as well as the
                   custom one used for the gist.github.com provider.

Optional params:
:type              HTTP Request TYPE, defaults to POST.

:post-data         Default post fields sent to service.  Defaults to nil.

:post-lang-field-name   Fieldname for defining which language your paste should
                        use to the provider.

:lang-overrides    Alist defining overrides for languages for this provider.  If
                   a mode is set to nil, it will use fundamental-mode\\='s
                   value as fallback.  Fundamental-mode\\='s value can also be
                   overridden.

:lang-uri-separator   Lang URI separator.  This is used for providers that
                      appends the language to the end of the resulting URI and
                      needs a separator between language and link.

:parser            Defines how request.el parses the result.  Look up :parser
                   for `request'.  This defaults to \\='buffer-string.

:error-lambda      Callback sent to `request', look up how to write these in the
                   documentation for `request'.  The default value for this is
                   `webpaste--providers-error-lambda', but there\\='s also
                   `webpaste--providers-error-lambda-no-failover' available if
                   you need a provider that isn\\='t allowed to failover.

:headers-lambda    Function that builds and returns headers that should be sent
                   to the provider. This can be useful to add authentication
                   for example.

:post-field-lambda Function that builds and returns the post data that should be
                   sent to the provider.  It should accept named parameters by
                   the names TEXT, POST-FIELD and POST-DATA.  POST-DATA should
                   default to `nil' or empty list.  It also takes the option
                   LANG-OVERRIDES which is a list that enables overriding of
                   `webpaste--default-lang-alist'.

                   TEXT contains the data that should be sent.
                   POST-FIELD contains the name of the field to be sent.
                   POST-DATA contains predefined fields that the provider needs.
                   SUCCESS-LAMBDA contains the function to run on an successful
                   paste."
